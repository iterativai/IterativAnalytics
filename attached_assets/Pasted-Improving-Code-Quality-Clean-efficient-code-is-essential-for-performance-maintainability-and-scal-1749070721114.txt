Improving Code Quality
Clean, efficient code is essential for performance, maintainability, and scalability.

Semantic HTML: Use appropriate HTML tags (e.g., <header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>, <section>, <article>) to structure your content logically. This improves accessibility and SEO.
Separate CSS and JavaScript: Avoid inline styles and scripts. Keep your CSS in external stylesheets (.css files) and JavaScript in external script files (.js files). This improves organization, maintainability, and caching.
Modular CSS (e.g., BEM, utility-first with Tailwind CSS): Organize your CSS into reusable components to avoid specificity issues and make styles easier to manage.
Optimize Images:
Compress Images: Use image optimization tools to reduce file sizes without sacrificing quality.
Choose Correct Formats: Use JPEG for photos, PNG for images with transparency, and SVG for vector graphics.
Responsive Images: Use srcset and sizes attributes in HTML to serve different image sizes based on the user's viewport, or use CSS max-width: 100%; height: auto;.
Lazy Loading: Implement lazy loading for images and other media below the fold to improve initial page load speed.
Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: Remove unnecessary characters (whitespace, comments) from your code to reduce file sizes.
Leverage Browser Caching: Configure your server to use caching headers for static assets (CSS, JS, images) so browsers can store them locally, reducing load times on repeat visits.
Reduce HTTP Requests: Combine CSS and JavaScript files where appropriate, and use CSS sprites for small icons to reduce the number of requests the browser needs to make.
Efficient JavaScript:
Minimize DOM Manipulation: Excessive direct manipulation of the Document Object Model can be slow. Batch updates or use frameworks that optimize this.
Debounce/Throttle Events: For events that fire frequently (e.g., scrolling, resizing), debounce or throttle their handlers to prevent performance issues.
Asynchronous Loading: Use defer or async attributes for script tags to prevent them from blocking the rendering of the page.
Accessibility (A11y) Best Practices:
Semantic HTML: (mentioned above)
Alt Text for Images: Provide descriptive alt text for all images for screen readers.
Keyboard Navigation: Ensure all interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard.
Color Contrast: Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background colors.
ARIA Attributes: Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes when necessary to provide more context to assistive technologies.
Version Control: Use Git to track changes to your code, collaborate with others, and easily revert to previous versions if needed.
